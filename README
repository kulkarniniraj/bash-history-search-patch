Applicable to readline library available with bash-4.2 (readline-5.1)

About:
======
	In normal Bash, up and down arrow keys are assigned to list out previous history commands. 
We needed a feature where rather than listing all previous commands, these arrow keys should trigger 
a search in history lines for part of command entered.
Eg. $ls(up_arrow_key) should take us through list of history commands which contain "ls" as its sub-string

	Bash have inbuilt functions history-search-backward and history-search-forward which does similar
job but search is restricted to start of history line only (ie. commands starting with given sub-string).

	This simple patch adds two new functionalities in Bash history-search-backward-new and 
history-search-forward-new which eliminates this restriction.

Installation:
=============
.Extract the bash source tar-ball(bash-4.2.tar.gz tested) 
.Apply the patch to the directory
	patch -p1 < bash_patch
.Compile and install Bash using instructions given in bash README

Key Configurations:
===================
Add following lines to .inputrc file located in home folder. Create the file if necessary.

"\e[A": history-search-backward-new
"\e[B": history-search-forward-new

First line reassigns functionality to UP arrow key
Second line reassigns functionality to DOWN arrow key
(Search code for you own key in "read" bash command)

Save the file and restart bash for changes to take effect

Optional:
=========
Change the default shell in /etc/passwd file for the user to /usr/local/bin/bash to make 
the modified shell as default shell
